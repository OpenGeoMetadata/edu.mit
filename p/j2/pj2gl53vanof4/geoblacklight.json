A recordcontains descriptive information about mineral deposits andmineral commodities. The types of information in the database include deposit name, location, commodity, depositdescription, geologic characteristics, production,reserves, potential resources, and references. The MineralResource Data System master database is not accessible viathe WWW. The large number of multi-valued fields make itdifficult to import all the fields into a data format thatcan be utilized by the ArcView Internet Map ServerSoftware. This dataset contains all MRDS locations, butonly 44 of the possible 226 fields. A data structure wascreated in Access 97. Data was imported into the filestructure and then processed into Arc View, where it wastransformed into shape files that are used by the IMSsoftware to serve the MRDS data and permit access via the www.", "dc_format_s": "Shapefile", "dc_publisher_s": "U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)", "dc_rights_s": "Public", "dc_subject_sm": ["Ore deposits"], "dc_title_s": "World (Ore deposits, 2003)", "dc_type_s": "Dataset", "dct_provenance_s": "MIT", "dct_spatial_sm": ["Earth (Planet)"], "dct_references_s": "{\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/geoserver/wms\", \"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wfs\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/geoserver/wfs\", \"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/metadata/SDE_DATA_INT_H1DEPOSIT_2003.xml\"}", "layer_geom_type_s": "Point", "layer_id_s": "mit:SDE_DATA_INT_H1DEPOSIT_2003", "layer_modified_dt": "2018-05-15T13:17:13Z", "layer_slug_s": "mit-pj2gl53vanof4", "solr_geom": "ENVELOPE(-176.729722, 179.549167, 78.380556, -73.000000)", "geoblacklight_version": "1.0"}
