{"dc_creator_sm": ["MassGIS (Office : Mass.)"], "dc_description_s": "The Central Transportation Planning Staff updated and enhanced railroad linework distributed by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) as 1:100,000 Digital Line Graphs (DLGs). The original 1:100,000 DLG data were conflated to the orthophoto-derived 1:5,000 Centerline linework. This data layer is much more detailed than pre-April 2004 trains data and has many more abandoned rail lines. In many instances there is more than one track per rail line, and rail yards and spurs are included.CTPS added several attributes pertaining to type of service, MBTA Commuter Rail status and stations (current and proposed, including the Greenbush line), rail line ownership, and freight and passenger operation.Stored in ArcSDE and distributed as shapefiles, the statewide layers include arcs (TRAINS_ARC), nodes (station locations, TRAINS_NODE) and routes (TRAINS_RTE_TRAIN). MassGIS also makes available an ArcInfo coverage version named TRAINS.Other tranportation linework that appears on the USGS 1:100,000-scale maps, such as pipelines and transmission lines, are included in the TRNSLNS layer. The MBTA subway lines are included in the MBTA layer.", "dc_format_s": "Shapefile", "dc_publisher_s": "MassGIS (Office : Mass.)", "dc_rights_s": "Public", "dc_subject_sm": ["Railroads", "Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority"], "dc_title_s": "Massachusetts (Train Stations 2004)", "dc_type_s": "Dataset", "dct_provenance_s": "MIT", "dct_spatial_sm": ["Massachusetts"], "dct_references_s": "{\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/geoserver/wms\", \"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wfs\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/geoserver/wfs\", \"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/metadata/SDE_DATA_US_MA_P3STATIONS_2004.xml\"}", "layer_geom_type_s": "Point", "layer_id_s": "mit:SDE_DATA_US_MA_P3STATIONS_2004", "layer_modified_dt": "2018-05-15T20:21:55Z", "layer_slug_s": "mit-amky6skv3jmhk", "solr_geom": "ENVELOPE(-73.448832, -69.923328, 42.979186, 41.256493)", "geoblacklight_version": "1.0"}
