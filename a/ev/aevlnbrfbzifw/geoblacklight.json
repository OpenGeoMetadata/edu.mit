{"dc_creator_sm": ["MassGIS (Office : Mass.)"], "dc_description_s": "The Long Distance Trails Datalayer is a line coverage representing trails that are longer than 25 miles. The data was created for the purpose of regional planning and mapping by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation and was modified for DCR (then DEM) by the University of Massachusetts in 1997.  At scales of 1:50,000 or smaller the data is reliable for all trails; between 1:50,000 and 1:25,000 the data quality of some trails may be significantly inaccurate; for scales greater than 1:25,000 the quality of most trails will be significantly inaccurate.
