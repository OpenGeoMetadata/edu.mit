{"dc_creator_sm": ["Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority"], "dc_description_s": "This dataset was created in ArcView through \"heads up\" digitizing, using MARTA's digital road network as a basemap.  ARC's GIS Division converted the original ArcView shapefile to ARC/INFO format for re-work in ArcEdit.  Some of the arcs were adjusted to improve the positional accuracy against the 1993 Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quad (DOQQ) imagery and to coincide with other layers primarily MARTA bus routes and rail stations.  ARC also used 1999 digital imagery for improved positional accuracy of the new expansion of the North Line to Sandy Springs and North Springs.The complete collection of Atlanta region geospatial datasets is available on CD in the GIS Lab at Rotch Library with the following call number: CDROM G3924.A8 2002.A7.", "dc_format_s": "Shapefile", "dc_publisher_s": "Atlanta Regional Commission", "dc_rights_s": "Public", "dc_subject_sm": ["Railroads", "Transportation"], "dc_title_s": "Atlanta, GA (MARTA Rail Lines, 2000)", "dc_type_s": "Dataset", "dct_provenance_s": "MIT", "dct_spatial_sm": ["Georgia--Atlanta"], "dct_references_s": "{\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/geoserver/wms\", \"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wfs\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/geoserver/wfs\", \"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/metadata/SDE_DATA_US_GA_ATLANTA_P33RR_2000.xml\"}", "layer_geom_type_s": "Line", "layer_id_s": "mit:SDE_DATA_US_GA_ATLANTA_P33RR_2000", "layer_modified_dt": "2018-05-15T19:31:57Z", "layer_slug_s": "mit-getjv33wnfiio", "solr_geom": "ENVELOPE(-84.470474, -84.229675, 33.943787, 33.640682)", "geoblacklight_version": "1.0"}
