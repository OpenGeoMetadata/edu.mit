{"dc_creator_sm": ["Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority"], "dc_description_s": "This layer was originally created using Global Positioning System (GPS) technology where rail stations were captured as point locations at adjacent drives or parking lots.   ARC's GIS Division adjusted many of the points to coincide with MARTA rail lines and bus routes, and to improve the positional accuracy against the 1993 Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quad (DOQQ) imagery.  ARC also used 1999 digital imagery for improved positional accuracy of the new North Line stations at Sandy Springs and North Springs.The complete collection of Atlanta region geospatial datasets is available on CD in the GIS Lab at Rotch Library with the following call number: CDROM G3924.A8 2002.A7.
