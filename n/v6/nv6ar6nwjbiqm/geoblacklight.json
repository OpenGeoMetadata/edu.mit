The FWW are network coverages with both linear and polygon wetlands delineated and coded. Linear wetlands features were reselected out of FWW to form this dataset.  Any arc that was a linear wetland feature was given a valid wetlands (CLASS) code in the original data set.Freshwater wetlands delineations were made on 1986 orthophoto quarterquad basemaps (1:12000) by photo interpretation of 1986 CIR photos.  The classification system used was a modified Cowardin system (Cowardin, et al., 1979).  All freshwater wetland polygons greater than 1 acre in area and all linear freshwater wetland features greater than 10 feet in width were mapped. The 1986 quarterquad basemaps meet NMAS and are orthophotos.", "dc_format_s": "Shapefile", "dc_publisher_s": "New Jersey.
