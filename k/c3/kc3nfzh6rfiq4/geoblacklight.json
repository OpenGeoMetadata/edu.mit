{"dc_creator_sm": ["MassGIS (Office : Mass.)"], "dc_description_s": "These polygon datalayers show the level of crime statistics by municipality in Massachusetts for the years 1980-2003. This data is Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) data. Municipalities contribute data voluntarily, therefore not all municipality have data and not all municipalities have 12 full months of data. These layers can be seen in State Police OLIVER (SPOLIVER). This data is collected by the Massachusetts State Police. The layers are stored in ArcSDE as spatial views in the EOPS schema and distributed by year as UCR_80_S_V through UCR_03_S_V (\"_S_V\" for spatial view).Data was broken up into layers by year (1980-2003).
