The routes are described in the National Hazardous Material Route Registry (NMHRR). The on-line NMHRR linkage is http://hazmat.fmcsa.dot.gov/nhmrr/index.asp With the exception of 13 features that were not identified with the Tiger/Lines, Hazmat routes were created by extracting the TIGER/Line segments that corresponded to each individual route.  Hazmat routes in the NTAD, are organized into 3 database files, hazmat.shp, hmroutes.dbf, and hmstcnty.dbf.  Each record in each database represents a unique Tiger/Line segment.  These Tiger/Line segments are grouped into routes identified as character strings in the ROUTE_ID field in the hmroutes.dbf table.  The route name appearing in the ROUTE_ID is assigned by FMCSA and is unique for each State [this sentence could be deleted - it doesn't add a lot to it].  The hmstcnty.dbf table allows the user to select routes by State and County.  A single shapefile, called hazmat.shp, represents geometry for all routes in the United States.", "dc_format_s": "Shapefile", "dc_publisher_s": "Research and Innovative Technology Administration's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (RITA/BTS)", "dc_rights_s": "Public", "dc_subject_sm": ["Hazardous substances"], "dc_title_s": "USA (Hazardous Materials Routes, 2006)", "dc_type_s": "Dataset", "dct_provenance_s": "MIT", "dct_spatial_sm": ["United States"], "dct_references_s": "{\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/geoserver/wms\", \"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wfs\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/geoserver/wfs\", \"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/metadata/SDE_DATA_US_P1HAZMAT_2006.xml\"}", "layer_geom_type_s": "Line", "layer_id_s": "mit:SDE_DATA_US_P1HAZMAT_2006", "layer_modified_dt": "2018-05-15T21:11:02Z", "layer_slug_s": "mit-kz5nn4bbfrowm", "solr_geom": "ENVELOPE(-124.216232, -71.051495, 49.000758, 26.111954)", "geoblacklight_version": "1.0"}
