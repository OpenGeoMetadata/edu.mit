The data set includes boundaries for urban areas in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.  A UA may contain both place and nonplace territory. The U.S. Census Bureau delineates UAs to provide a better separation of urban and rural territory, population, and housing in the vicinity of large places. At least 35,000 people in a UA must live in an area that is not part of a military reservation.", "dc_format_s": "Shapefile", "dc_publisher_s": "Research and Innovative Technology Administration's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (RITA/BTS)", "dc_rights_s": "Public", "dc_subject_sm": ["Administrative and political divisions"], "dc_title_s": "USA (Urbanized Area Boundaries, 2000)", "dc_type_s": "Dataset", "dct_provenance_s": "MIT", "dct_spatial_sm": ["United States"], "dct_references_s": "{\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/geoserver/wms\", \"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wfs\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/geoserver/wfs\", \"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/metadata/SDE_DATA_US_E2URBNAREA_2000.xml\"}", "layer_geom_type_s": "Polygon", "layer_id_s": "mit:SDE_DATA_US_E2URBNAREA_2000", "layer_modified_dt": "2018-05-15T19:21:28Z", "layer_slug_s": "mit-tb4xjaxndvjck", "solr_geom": "ENVELOPE(-158.231956, 145.794619, 64.920865, 13.337161)", "geoblacklight_version": "1.0"}
