An Urbanized Area is a concept used by the U.S. Census Bureau to measure the population, land area and population density of a built-up or continuously developed area, which in most cases extends outside of the political boundaries of the core city.  Based on core census block groups or blocks, UA boundaries are delineated to encompass densely settled areas which have a population density of at least 1,000 people per square mile and surrounding areas that have an overall density of at least 500 people per square mile.  The Urbanized_Area_1990 Layer located on this CD represents the previous Urbanized Area for Atlanta.Attributes:\tCOUNTY\tState and county FIPS codeUACODE\tUrbanized Area code \t(Note that three excluded polygons were \"Added\" by ARC)NAME\tCommon name of urbanized area", "dc_format_s": "Shapefile", "dc_publisher_s": "Atlanta Regional Commission", "dc_rights_s": "Public", "dc_subject_sm": ["City planning"], "dc_title_s": "Georgia (Urbanized Area, 2000)", "dc_type_s": "Dataset", "dct_provenance_s": "MIT", "dct_spatial_sm": ["Georgia"], "dct_references_s": "{\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/geoserver/wms\", \"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wfs\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/geoserver/wfs\", \"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/metadata/SDE_DATA_US_GA_E25URBAN_2000.xml\"}", "layer_geom_type_s": "Polygon", "layer_id_s": "mit:SDE_DATA_US_GA_E25URBAN_2000", "layer_modified_dt": "2018-05-15T19:32:00Z", "layer_slug_s": "mit-ixjv4r55ejnl4", "solr_geom": "ENVELOPE(-85.526105, -80.726461, 34.990343, 30.705026)", "geoblacklight_version": "1.0"}
