In some cases, features were digitized on-screen from 2003 or 2005 digital orthophotography provided by CCWA.  ARC's GIS Division then merged the original shapefiles into a single database for ease of use on this CD.  For more information, go to http://web.co.clayton.ga.us/ctran/index.htm.  Pleae note there are a total of 5 (bus) transit Layers on this CD including CCT, Ctran, GCT, GRTA and MARTA.  The geographic extent of this Transit_CTRAN Layer is sub-regional with features located primarily in Clayton County and secondarily in Fulton County.Attributes:\tC_TRAN\tOne or more route numbers for road segment recordRoute\tRoute number of predominant route", "dc_format_s": "Shapefile", "dc_publisher_s": "Atlanta Regional Commission", "dc_rights_s": "Public", "dc_subject_sm": ["Bus lines", "Transportation"], "dc_title_s": "Atlanta, GA (CTRAN Bus Routes, 2006)", "dc_type_s": "Dataset", "dct_provenance_s": "MIT", "dct_spatial_sm": ["Georgia--Atlanta"], "dct_references_s": "{\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/geoserver/wms\", \"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wfs\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/geoserver/wfs\", \"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/metadata/SDE_DATA_US_GA_ATLANTA_P22CTRAN_2006.xml\"}", "layer_geom_type_s": "Line", "layer_id_s": "mit:SDE_DATA_US_GA_ATLANTA_P22CTRAN_2006", "layer_modified_dt": "2018-05-15T19:31:44Z", "layer_slug_s": "mit-imswh24dq5jnu", "solr_geom": "ENVELOPE(-84.459908, -84.299079, 33.658140, 33.502833)", "geoblacklight_version": "1.0"}
