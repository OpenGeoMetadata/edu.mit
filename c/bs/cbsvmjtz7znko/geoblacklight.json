{"dc_creator_sm": ["USGS", "Markhurd Corp.", "New Jersey. Department of Environmental Protection"], "dc_description_s": "This data was created by combining two separate data sets, the land use/land cover layer from the Integrated Terrain Unit Maps (ITUM) for this county and the freshwater wetlands (FWW) layer generated under the New Jersey Freshwater Wetlands Mapping Program. The Arc/INFO LULC coverage has been converted to an ArcView shapefile for distribution.The ITUM land use/land cover was photo interpreted from 1986 color infrared  (CIR) 1:58000 aerial photos, and delineated using a modified Anderson et al. 1976, classification system to 1:24000 rectified photo-basemaps.  These basemaps complied with National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS) as individual quadrangles but were not produced from a sophisticated aero-triangulation photogrammetric solution. Minimum mapping unit = 2.5 acres. The ITUM land use/land cover was integrated with three other sources (soils, USGS floodprone areas, and 1906 Atlas Sheet Geology) based on coincident features. The four data layers have subsequently been split out into four separate themes for distribution and use. Beginning in 1998, the NJDEP does not support the data as a single integrated ITUM theme but rather as four separate themes.Freshwater wetlands delineations were made on 1986 orthophoto quarterquad basemaps (1:12000) by photo interpretation of 1986 CIR photos.  The classification system used was a modified Cowardin system (Cowardin, et al., 1979).  All freshwater wetland polygons greater than 1 acre in area and all linear freshwater wetland features greater than 10 feet in width were mapped. The 1986 quarterquad basemaps meet NMAS and are orthophotos.", "dc_format_s": "Shapefile", "dc_publisher_s": "USGS", "dc_rights_s": "Public", "dc_subject_sm": ["Wetlands", "Land cover", "Land use"], "dc_title_s": "New Jersey (Land Use Land Cover, 1998)", "dc_type_s": "Dataset", "dct_provenance_s": "MIT", "dct_spatial_sm": ["New Jersey"], "dct_references_s": "{\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/geoserver/wms\", \"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wfs\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/geoserver/wfs\", \"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/metadata/SDE_DATA_US_NJ_G4LULC_1998.xml\"}", "layer_geom_type_s": "Polygon", "layer_id_s": "mit:SDE_DATA_US_NJ_G4LULC_1998", "layer_modified_dt": "2018-05-15T20:25:11Z", "layer_slug_s": "mit-cbsvmjtz7znko", "solr_geom": "ENVELOPE(-74.27358, -73.89243, 41.13425, 40.76088)", "geoblacklight_version": "1.0"}
