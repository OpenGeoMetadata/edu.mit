{"dc_creator_sm": ["City of Cambridge GIS"], "dc_description_s": "This layer contains lines showing how parcels were historically divided in the Assessor's database, where two or more lots were merged into a single parcel. When the layer was originally created, it was used to illustrate lots that were owned and used in common and were combined to form a \"main lot\" for valuation purposes. More recently, any parcels that are merged trigger the creation of a sited parcel line to retain a historical record of the original parcel boundaries.
