This list of Known Contaminated Sites may include sites where remediation is either currently under way, required but not yet initiated or has been completed. The data included here dates from 2001.  It is important to note that some of the cases listed may have been fully remediated and should no longer be listed as known contaminated sites.  Additionally new contaminated sites have been identified since the creation of this list and are not included here.  For further information contact NJDEP's Site Remediation Program and Waste Management (SRWM)  lead program, which are identified with each site listed in this data base.
