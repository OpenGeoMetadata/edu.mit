{"dc_creator_sm": ["MassGIS (Office : Mass.)"], "dc_description_s": "This layer represents the coastal components of the priority natural vegetation communities in MA. This layer is one of eight that depict the distribution of natural community systems identified by the Massachusetts Natural Heritage and Endangered Species Program (NHESP) as most critical to the conservation of the Commonwealth's biological diversity (Barbour et al., 1998).These eight layers are: coastal, coastal plain pond, vernal pool, acidic peatland, riverine, maritime sandplain, pine barrens, calcareous. For descriptions of these community systems, refer to Barbour, Simmons, Swain and Woolsey, \"Our Irreplaceable Heritage: Protecting Biodiversity in Massachusetts\" (1998). SPECIFICS FOR THE SANDPLAIN COMMUNITIES:Sandplain Systems are complex mosaics of native grassland and heathland found on dry sandy soils, usually near the coast.  Most of this data in the southeast is a subset of grassland and heathland types from the UMass Plymouth pitch pine data, with some polygons removed, added or changed based on review of the 1999/2000 aerial photos and field information. In areas outside of the UMass project area, polygons were interpreted and digitized from the aerial photos. Non-sandplain grasslands that might still have habitat value are included as GR, CGR, or G2.MassGIS is maintaining this layer.  Questions concerning the data interpretation should be directed to Janice Stone at 413-545-5533 or Philip John at 617-626-1185.  Development of this information in other regions of the state is continuing.", "dc_format_s": "Shapefile", "dc_publisher_s": "MassGIS (Office : Mass.)", "dc_rights_s": "Public", "dc_subject_sm": ["Heathlands", "Habitat (Ecology)", "Conservation of natural resources", "Grasslands", "Floods", "Plants"], "dc_title_s": "Massachusetts (Priority Natural Sandplain Vegetation Communities, 2003) ", "dc_type_s": "Dataset", "dct_provenance_s": "MIT", "dct_spatial_sm": ["Massachusetts"], "dct_references_s": "{\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/geoserver/wms\", \"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wfs\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/geoserver/wfs\", \"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/metadata/SDE_DATA_US_MA_D5SNDPL_2003.xml\"}", "layer_geom_type_s": "Point", "layer_id_s": "mit:SDE_DATA_US_MA_D5SNDPL_2003", "layer_modified_dt": "2018-05-15T19:59:35Z", "layer_slug_s": "mit-7oyllr4xhzpec", "solr_geom": "ENVELOPE(-71.319227, -70.518958, 42.884353, 41.506427)", "geoblacklight_version": "1.0"}
