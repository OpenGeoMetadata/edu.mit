This Layer was  created using ARC's streetbase, ARstreets as a base map where GRTA's \"Xpress\" service bus routes were \"trace\" digitized on-screen over ARstreets road segments or photo-interpreted from 2003 digital orthophotography (Aerials Express, Inc.).  This Layer currently reflects \"Xpress\" routes in service as of December 31, 2005 and is generally updated annually during the first quarter of each calendar year.  For more information, go to http://www.xpressga.com.  Please note, there are a total of 5 (bus) transit Layers on this CD including CCT, Ctran, GCT, GRTA and MARTA.  The geographic extent of this Transit_GRTA Layer is the 13-county Atlanta region with the exception of Paulding and Fayette counties.Attributes:\tRTE_ID\tBus route numberRTE_DESC\tBus route description", "dc_format_s": "Shapefile", "dc_publisher_s": "Atlanta Regional Commission", "dc_rights_s": "Public", "dc_subject_sm": ["Bus lines", "Transportation"], "dc_title_s": "Atlanta, GA (GRTA Bus Routes, 2005)", "dc_type_s": "Dataset", "dct_provenance_s": "MIT", "dct_spatial_sm": ["Georgia--Atlanta"], "dct_references_s": "{\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/geoserver/wms\", \"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wfs\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/geoserver/wfs\", \"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/metadata/SDE_DATA_US_GA_ATLANTA_P22GRTA_2005.xml\"}", "layer_geom_type_s": "Line", "layer_id_s": "mit:SDE_DATA_US_GA_ATLANTA_P22GRTA_2005", "layer_modified_dt": "2018-05-15T19:31:47Z", "layer_slug_s": "mit-7iy3wdjaabkdo", "solr_geom": "ENVELOPE(-84.798553, -84.057971, 34.206090, 33.382310)", "geoblacklight_version": "1.0"}
