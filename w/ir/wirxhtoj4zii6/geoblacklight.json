{"dc_creator_sm": ["Platts"], "dc_description_s": "The Platts Power Plant geospatial data layer contains point features representing power generating facilities in North America.  Although a power plant may have multiple generators, or units, the power plant layer represents all units at a plant as one feature.   Detailed attribute information associated with the power plant layer includes fuel types, prime movers, operational and financial statistics.  Utility and Non-Utility operated power plants with at least 4.5 MW of demonstrated capacity, plus many smaller power plants, are represented by this layer.  In addition, power plants in all stages of development, including proposed, tabled, and under construction are included.", "dc_format_s": "Shapefile", "dc_publisher_s": "Platts", "dc_rights_s": "Restricted", "dc_subject_sm": ["Coal-fired power plants", "Hydroelectric power plants", "Electric power-plants", "Power resources", "Nuclear power plants", "Natural gas", "Power-plants"], "dc_title_s": "North America (Power Plants, Dec. 2008)", "dc_type_s": "Dataset", "dct_provenance_s": "MIT", "dct_spatial_sm": ["North America", "United States", "Latin America", "Mexico", "Canada"], "dct_references_s": "{\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/mitgeoserver/wms\", \"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wfs\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/mitgeoserver/wfs\", \"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/metadata/SDE_DATA_NA_N3PWRPLANTS_12_2008.xml\"}", "layer_geom_type_s": "Point", "layer_id_s": "mit:SDE_DATA_NA_N3PWRPLANTS_12_2008", "layer_modified_dt": "2018-05-15T14:14:07Z", "layer_slug_s": "mit-wirxhtoj4zii6", "solr_geom": "ENVELOPE(-171.742515, -52.955172, 71.287583, 14.900000)", "geoblacklight_version": "1.0"}
