ARC's GIS Division then merged the original local and express shapefiles into a single database for ease of use on this CD.  None of the bus route numbers are currently linked to the features, but these route numbers, as well as route beginning and ending points, can be obtained from Cobb DOT's Web.  For more information, go to http://www.cobbdot.org.  Please note there are a total of 5 (bus) transit Layers on this CD including CCT, Ctran, GCT, GRTA and MARTA.  The geographic extent of this Transit_CCT Layer is sub-regional with features located primarily in Cobb County and secondarily in Fulton, Cherokee, Douglas and Paulding counties.Attributes:TYPE\tExpress or Local", "dc_format_s": "Shapefile", "dc_publisher_s": "Atlanta Regional Commission", "dc_rights_s": "Public", "dc_subject_sm": ["Bus lines", "Transportation"], "dc_title_s": "Atlanta, GA (CCT Bus Routes, 2005)", "dc_type_s": "Dataset", "dct_provenance_s": "MIT", "dct_spatial_sm": ["Georgia--Atlanta", "Georgia--Cobb County"], "dct_references_s": "{\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/geoserver/wms\", \"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wfs\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/geoserver/wfs\", \"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/metadata/SDE_DATA_US_GA_ATLANTA_P22CCT_2005.xml\"}", "layer_geom_type_s": "Line", "layer_id_s": "mit:SDE_DATA_US_GA_ATLANTA_P22CCT_2005", "layer_modified_dt": "2018-05-15T19:31:43Z", "layer_slug_s": "mit-5mf2nptcf5pae", "solr_geom": "ENVELOPE(-84.743136, -84.345001, 34.228872, 33.739932)", "geoblacklight_version": "1.0"}
