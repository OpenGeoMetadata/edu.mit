It presents a State by State summary analysis of the number, location, and general condition of highway bridges within each State.Although the inventory contains locational information, it's accuracy is unverified, and in many cases the information is not provided or incorrect.  Using information from the inventory, an attempt was made to conflate the bridges to a common reference network, TeleAtlas's DynaMap for Transportation.  Over 75% of the inventroy was successfully conflated.  the remaining bridges are included in this shapefile, but are located at longitude-latitude 0-0.", "dc_format_s": "Shapefile", "dc_publisher_s": "FHWA", "dc_rights_s": "Public", "dc_subject_sm": ["Transportation"], "dc_title_s": "USA (National Bridge Inventory, 2008)", "dc_type_s": "Dataset", "dct_provenance_s": "MIT", "dct_spatial_sm": ["United States"], "dct_references_s": "{\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/geoserver/wms\", \"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wfs\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/geoserver/wfs\", \"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/metadata/SDE_DATA_US_P24BRIDGES_2008.xml\"}", "layer_geom_type_s": "Point", "layer_id_s": "mit:SDE_DATA_US_P24BRIDGES_2008", "layer_modified_dt": "2018-05-15T21:11:42Z", "layer_slug_s": "mit-5dakxma44vojc", "solr_geom": "ENVELOPE(-168.093128, 0.000000, 68.644622, 0.000000)", "geoblacklight_version": "1.0"}
