The underlying geography is derived from the Department of City Planning's Tax Block and Tax Lot Base Map project.  The tax lots have been clipped to the shoreline, as defined by NYCmap planimetric features.  The attribute information is the Department of City Planning's PLUTO database application.  The attribute data pertains to tax lot and primary building characteristics and information related to administrative and political districts for each tax lot in New York City.  The Tax Lot Basemap and PLUTO are derived from different sources.   As a result, some PLUTO records did not have a corresponding tax lot in the base map at the time of release.  These records are included in a separate non-geographic DBase (*.dbf) table.", "dc_format_s": "Shapefile", "dc_publisher_s": "New York (N.Y.).
