The five ‘T’ lines - Blue, Green, Orange, Red and Silver - are represented with linework in the layer MBTA_ARC. Stations are contained in a point feature class named MBTA_NODE. The layers were developed by the Central Transportation Planning Staff (CTPS). The MBTA Commuter Rail lines are included in the TRAINS layer.It should be noted that the Silver Line actually consists of buses, not trains, but the line is included in this layer because the MBTA includes it as part of its Subway system (see http://www.mbta.com/traveling_t/schedules_subway.asp).", "dc_format_s": "Shapefile", "dc_publisher_s": "MassGIS (Office : Mass.)", "dc_rights_s": "Public", "dc_subject_sm": ["Local transit", "Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority", "Subways"], "dc_title_s": "Boston, MA (MBTA Subway Lines, 2006)", "dc_type_s": "Dataset", "dct_provenance_s": "MIT", "dct_spatial_sm": ["Massachusetts--Boston Metropolitan Area"], "dct_references_s": "{\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/geoserver/wms\", \"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wfs\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/geoserver/wfs\", \"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/metadata/SDE_DATA_US_MA_BOSTON_P33MBTA_2006.xml\"}", "layer_geom_type_s": "Line", "layer_id_s": "mit:SDE_DATA_US_MA_BOSTON_P33MBTA_2006", "layer_modified_dt": "2018-05-15T19:46:47Z", "layer_slug_s": "mit-o43rctabzfo26", "solr_geom": "ENVELOPE(-71.253517, -70.990840, 42.438021, 42.207458)", "geoblacklight_version": "1.0"}
