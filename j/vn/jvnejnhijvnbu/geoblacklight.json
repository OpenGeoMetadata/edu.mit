The data set includes boundaries for urban areas in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.  A UA may contain both place and nonplace territory. The U.S. Census Bureau delineates UAs to provide a better separation of urban and rural territory, population, and housing in the vicinity of large places.
