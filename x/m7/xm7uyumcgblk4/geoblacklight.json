The paneling scheme for the 1:25,000 (DLG) data is based on this digital quadrangle template of 210 quadrangles. The grid differs from the Quadrangle Template, which is based on the 1:25,000 USGS 7.5 minute topographic quadrangles. For most of Massachusetts, though, the paneling schemes are identical. The quadrangle panels and numbering scheme vary along the coast, primarily for the Cape and Islands quads. Please refer to the appendix for a map of both grids and a listing of the corresponding datalayers that are paneled by each grid.
