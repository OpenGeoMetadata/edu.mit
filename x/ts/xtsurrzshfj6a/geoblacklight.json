In other words, the development rights have been transferred away (sent) to another area. TDR sending areas have greater restrictions for development, i.e. fewer rights. Transfer of development rights (sending) and purchase of development rights (receiving) is an innovative technique for enabling development outside of Urban Growth Areas that would otherwise be incompatible with the comprehensive plan.
