The Surface Water Quality Standards (SWQS) establish the designated uses to be achieved and specify the water quality (criteria) necessary to protect the State's waters.  Designated uses include potable water, propagation of fish and wildlife, recreation, agricultural and industrial supplies, and navigation.  These are reflected in use classifications assigned to specific waters.  The linework has been broken/altered to reflect the location written in the standards text.  When interpreting the surface water quality standards, the Surface Water Quality Standards regulations at N.J.A.C. 7:9B always take precedence.
