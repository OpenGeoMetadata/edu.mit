None of the bus route numbers are currently linked to the features, but this and other information can be obtained from MARTA's Website.  For more information, go to http://www.itsmarta.com.  Please note there are a total of 5 (bus) transit Layers on this CD including CCT, Ctran, GCT, GRTA and MARTA.  The geographic extent of this Transit_Marta_Bus Layer is sub-regional with features located almost exclusively in Fulton and DeKalb counties.
