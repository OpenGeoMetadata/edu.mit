{"dc_creator_sm": ["MassGIS (Office : Mass.)"], "dc_description_s": "This dataset contains points which represent locations of all libraries currently registered with the Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners (MBLC). MassGIS created the layer from a list received from the MBLC. The list was current as of October, 2004 and contained the addresses and a few other related attributes for every library that currently meets the MBLC eligibility requirements for registration with the state (see http://mblc.state.ma.us/mblc/regional/membership/eligibility.php). Please note that not all libraries in the Commonwealth are compliant with these requirements, and therefore were not included in the list. If a library appears to be missing from the dataset, it is not registered with the MBLC as of October, 2004, and needs to do so to be considered in future updates.In ArcSDE the layer is named LIBRARIES_PT.", "dc_format_s": "Shapefile", "dc_publisher_s": "MassGIS (Office : Mass.)", "dc_rights_s": "Public", "dc_subject_sm": ["Hospitals", "Education", "Libraries", "Prisons", "Public institutions"], "dc_title_s": "Massachusetts (Libraries, 2005)", "dc_type_s": "Dataset", "dct_provenance_s": "MIT", "dct_spatial_sm": ["Massachusetts"], "dct_references_s": "{\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/geoserver/wms\", \"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wfs\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/geoserver/wfs\", \"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/metadata/SDE_DATA_US_MA_E67LIBRARIES_2005.xml\"}", "layer_geom_type_s": "Point", "layer_id_s": "mit:SDE_DATA_US_MA_E67LIBRARIES_2005", "layer_modified_dt": "2018-05-15T20:02:25Z", "layer_slug_s": "mit-hvi26mblobkpe", "solr_geom": "ENVELOPE(-73.501661, -69.929941, 42.867356, 41.254880)", "geoblacklight_version": "1.0"}
