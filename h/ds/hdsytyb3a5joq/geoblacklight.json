{"dc_creator_sm": ["City of Cambridge, MA"], "dc_description_s": "City of Cambridge, MA GIS basemap development project encompasses the land area of City of Cambridge with a 200 foot fringe surrounding the area and Charles River shoreline towards Boston. The basemap data was developed at 1\" = 40' mapping scale using digital photogrammetric techniques. Planimetric features; both man-made and natural features like vegetation, rivers have been depicted. These features are important to all GIS/mapping applications and publication. A set of data layers such as Buildings, Roads, Rivers, Utility structures, 1 ft interval contours are developed and represented in the geodatabase. The features are labeled and coded in order to represent specific feature class for thematic representation and topology between the features is maintained for an accurate representation at the 1:40 mapping scale for both publication and analysis.", "dc_format_s": "Shapefile", "dc_publisher_s": "Cambridge (MA) Geographic Information System (City of Cambridge GIS)", "dc_rights_s": "Restricted", "dc_subject_sm": ["Altitudes"], "dc_title_s": "Cambridge, MA (Spot Annotation)", "dc_type_s": "Dataset", "dct_provenance_s": "MIT", "dct_spatial_sm": ["Massachusetts--Cambridge"], "dct_references_s": "{\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/mitgeoserver/wms\", \"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wfs\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/mitgeoserver/wfs\", \"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/metadata/SDE_DATA_US_MA_CAMBRIDGE_A2SPTANNO_2010.xml\"}", "layer_geom_type_s": "Polygon", "layer_id_s": "mit:SDE_DATA_US_MA_CAMBRIDGE_A2SPTANNO_2010", "layer_modified_dt": "2018-05-15T19:52:17Z", "layer_slug_s": "mit-hdsytyb3a5joq", "solr_geom": "ENVELOPE(-71.163986, -71.056155, 42.405572, 42.347255)", "geoblacklight_version": "1.0"}
