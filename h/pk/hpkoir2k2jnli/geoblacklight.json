Boundary lines were checked against other boundary delineations such as Patton, Hagstrom, and county freeholder maps. Inconsistencies when found were evaluated and in many cases the Township Engineers were called or tax sheets viewed. Changes were made when inconsistencies with other maps were found based on preponderance of data. In area where the line was labeled as approximate, attempts were made to correctly locate the boundary. The 1986 photoquads were used to move the boundary lines to photo-identifiable features as needed. Changes of less than 5 acres were not made. This coverage was DISSOLVED from New Jersey's Statewide Municipality coverage (stmun).In January 2003 the Census 2000 population information was joined to the former stco coverage to create this stco data layer.  Additional attributes included population in 1990 and 1980, and population change between each census.", "dc_format_s": "Shapefile", "dc_publisher_s": "USGS", "dc_rights_s": "Public", "dc_subject_sm": ["Administrative and political divisions", "Census districts", "Counties", "Population"], "dc_title_s": "New Jersey (Counties, 2003)", "dc_type_s": "Dataset", "dct_provenance_s": "MIT", "dct_spatial_sm": ["New Jersey"], "dct_references_s": "{\"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wms\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/geoserver/wms\", \"http://www.opengis.net/def/serviceType/ogc/wfs\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/geoserver/wfs\", \"http://www.opengis.net/cat/csw/csdgm\": \"https://geodata.mit.edu/metadata/SDE_DATA_US_NJ_F7COUNTIES_2003.xml\"}", "layer_geom_type_s": "Polygon", "layer_id_s": "mit:SDE_DATA_US_NJ_F7COUNTIES_2003", "layer_modified_dt": "2018-05-15T20:25:06Z", "layer_slug_s": "mit-hpkoir2k2jnli", "solr_geom": "ENVELOPE(-75.587306, -73.890363, 41.357564, 38.924819)", "geoblacklight_version": "1.0"}
